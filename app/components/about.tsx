        My coding journey begat at 11 years old, when I was first introduced to
        HTML (when marquees were cool) and CSS. Life got in the way and I ended
        up doing some freelance writing and desk jobs.

        The coding gods must have been watching, because in 2021, I was granted
        a scholarship and joined the Northcoders Full Stack Coding Bootcamp
        remotely. It was an intensive 13-week bootcamp that became my solid
        foundation and kickstarted my career in development. You can read
        through my journey here, where I blogged my experience weekly.
